          Pokémon is a series of video games developed by Game Freak and
          published by Nintendo and The Pokémon Company as part of the Pokémon
          media franchise. Created by Satoshi Tajiri with assistance from Ken
          Sugimori,the first games released in 1996 in Japan for the Game Boy,
          and the main series of role-playing video games (RPGs), also referred
          as the "core series" by their developers

            <p>
              Water is one of the three basic elemental types along with Fire
              and Grass, which constitute the three starter Pokémon. This
              creates a simple triangle to explain the type concept easily to
              new players. Water is the most common type with over 100 Pokémon,
              which are based on a wide variety of fish and other sea-dwelling
              creatures.

              Fire is one of the three basic elemental types along with Water

              creates a simple triangle to explain the type concept easily to
              new players. Fire types are notoriously rare in the early stages
              of the games so choosing the Fire variation starter is often a
              plus.

              The AR game's potential for weight loss was a big part of that
              discussion. In the process of getting out their doors and visiting
              parks, players found they were losing weight almost in spite of
              themselves. A Reddit Pokémon Go fan won acclaim for reporting that
              he'd lost 65 pounds between July and December.

              2016, the game remains incredibly popular.

        <p>Questions Every Pokemon Trainer Should Be Able To Answer</p>
        <ol class="order">
          <li>
            What Pokemon does Pikachu evolve into?
            <ul class="unorder">
              <li>
                We're sure you know this Electric mouse Pokemon, and you know it
                quite well. Basic knowledge of Pikachu is essential for every
                trainer, but you should also be well versed in the rodent's
                evolutionary chain. Pikachu, mighty as it is, has an even
                stronger evolved form also capable of generating vast amounts of
                electricity. Maybe you've bumped into this species in the wild.
                Either way, this is a question all Pokemon trainers should be
                able to answer.
              </li>
              <li>Answer is Raichu</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            What's the most effective Poke Ball in the game?
            <ul class="unorder">
              <li>
                Not all Poke Balls are made equally. There's the basic model you
                start your journey off with, but progressive upgrades are needed
                if you're looking to keep up with some of the stronger wild
                Pokemon who emerge in later routes. If you've made your way
                through any Pokemon game, you've reached the point where you're
                presented with the most effective Poke Ball known to man. This
                is a one shot catch, and no button mashing at all is required.
              </li>
              <li>Answer is Master Ball</li>

              have slightly different multipliers to the main Pokémon games -
              although a December 2018 update brought them slightly closer in
